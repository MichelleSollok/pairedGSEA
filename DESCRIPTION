Description: pairedGSEA makes it easy as 1-2-3 to run a paired Differential Gene Expression (DGE) and Differencital Gene Splicing (DGS) analysis.
  The package allows you to store intermediate results for further investiation, if desired.
  And its comes with a wrapper function for running an Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and plotting the results.
